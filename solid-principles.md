{% hint style="info" %}
SOLID and design patterns work together, with SOLID providing the principles and design patterns offering technical implementations. But SOLID itself is not considered a design pattern.
{% endhint %}

## S: Single Responsibility Principle

> Each class/module should have only one reason to change.

## O: Open/Closed Principle

> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## L: Liskov Substitution Principle

> Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

## I: Interface Segregation Principle

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

## D: Dependency Inversion Principle

> Depend on abstractions rather than concretions.
